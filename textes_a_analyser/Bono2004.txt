Impacts of Summer 2003 Heat Wave in Europe
The extreme drought and heat wave that hit Europe in the summer of 2003 had enormous adverse social, economic and environmental effects, such as the death of thousands of vulnerable elderly people, the destruction of large areas of forests by fire, and effects on water ecosystems and glaciers. It caused power cuts and transport restrictions and a decreased agricultural production. The losses are estimated to exceed 13 billion euros.
